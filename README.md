# Simple-Calculator
A calculator "base" of sorts that will be designed to be upgraded and forked into one that can support graphs and other, more complex computations with variables and have easy access to common conversions like weight, money, etc.

Currently: creating buttons for input and have all button functionality available for evaluating

Next steps: making evaluating possible with the calculator in the back end
